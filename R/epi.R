#' Disability adjusted life years

#' Calculate Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) and Disability-Adjusted Life-Years
#' based on disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study. To estimate
#' YLL we assume the average life expectancy for a person aged x years taken from the UN WPP
#' Africa profile for 2022. To estimate the expected age in a given range we assume
#' exponentially distributed ages with the range. 
#' YLLs are calculated by multiplying deaths by the number of years an individual was expected to live past their year of death.
