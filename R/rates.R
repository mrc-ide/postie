#' Extract basic rates from malariasimulation model output
#'
#' Summarises clinical incidence `clinical`, severe incidence `severe` and mortality `mortality`
#' rates as well as per-capita years lived with disability `yld_pp`, years of life
#' lost `yll_pp` and daly `dalys_pp`.
#'
#' For DALYs: disability weights are from the Global Burden of Disease study. To estimate
#' YLL we assume the average life expectancy for a person aged x years taken from the UN WPP
#' Africa profile for 2022. To estimate the expected age in a given range we assume
#' exponentially distributed ages with the range. Disability weights sourced:
#'  \href{https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2017-disability-weights}{here}.
#' This is an approximation of YLD estimation from the GBD study; disability due to comorbid conditions
#' such as motor impairment and aneamia are excluded.
#'
#' Note: Default parameter values are for _Plasmodium falciparum_
#'
#' @param x Input data.frame
#' @param time_divisor Aggregation level. Default = 1 (no aggregation).
#' Setting to 365 would allow annual aggregation, 30 monthly, 7 weekly etc.
#' @param baseline_t A baseline time to add to the time output
#' @param age_divisor To transform the age units. For example setting 365 will return age units in years for age-disaggregated outputs
#' @param scaler Scaler for severe cases to deaths. The
#' original fitted scaler for P. falciparum is 0.215. See
#' \href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00423-5/fulltext}{Griffin et al (2016)}.
#' @param treatment_scaler The impact of treatment coverage on progression to severe disease and death.
#' The probability of being hospitalised for untreated cases compared to treated cases is difficult to study and is not known, but can 
#' be estimated from available data with several assumptions. Our estimate is derived from data used in a meta-analysis on the impact 
#' of delayed treatment of uncomplicated malaria on progression to severe malaria 
#' \href{https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003359}{(Mousa et al, 2020, Plos Medicine)}, which estimated 
#' the relative risk ratio for treatment delays of 1-2, 2-3 and >3 days compared to treatment within 1 day. Here, we assume that the 
#' risk of hospitalisation with severe malaria among untreated cases would be double the risk in this last “delay category” of >3 days 
#' (2 * RR 1.186), giving a relative risk of any severe malaria of 0.578 for treatment within 1 day compared to no treatment (i.e. a treatment
#' scaler of 0.42 for the proportion of severe malaria cases that are prevented by treatment of uncomplicated malaria). However, in sensitivity
#' analysis a range of 0.281-0.843 should be considered for the treatment scaler, which was derived by assuming the risk among untreated cases
#' would be the same as the risk with a treatment delay of >3 days (lower estimate) or 3 times the risk as those with a treatment delay of
#' >3 days (upper estimate).
#' @param aggregate_age Aggregate output over age groups
#' @param mild_disability_weight disability weight for mild malaria. Assigned to clinical cases in those over 5 years old
#' @param moderate_disability_weight disability weight for moderate malaria. Assigned to clinical cases in those under 5 years old
#' @param severe_disability_weight disability weight for severe malaria. Assigned to all severe cases
#' @param clinical_episode_length average length of an episode of clinical malaria
#' @param severe_episode_length average length of an episode of severe malaria
